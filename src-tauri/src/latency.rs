//! Round-trip measurement through the live tunnel.
//!
//! The engine reports a latency figure exactly once, on the log line that
//! announces the selected gateway (`rtt 84.5ms`). That is a single number from
//! the moment of connecting, so it cannot answer the question the status screen
//! actually asks: is the route still good *now*.
//!
//! So we measure it ourselves. A SOCKS5 CONNECT through the local listener out
//! to a fixed address times the whole path — client, engine, MASQUE tunnel,
//! edge, and the TCP handshake at the far end. It is the same work a browser
//! does to open a connection, which is what makes it worth showing.
